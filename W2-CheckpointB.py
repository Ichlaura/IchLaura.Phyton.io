print ("Quantum computing or quantum computing1 is a computing paradigm different from that of classical computing or classical computing. It is based on the use of qubits, a special combination of ones and zeros. Classic computing bits can be 1 or 0, but only one state at a time; while the qubits can have the two simultaneous states as well. This gives rise to new logic gates that make new algorithms possible.")
