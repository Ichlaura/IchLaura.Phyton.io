          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    
          <h3>Academic</h3>
          <p>Laura Nuñez (b. 1993) is a Colombian-born Physics. Laura received a Bachelo\
            r Degree in Physics teacher from Universidad Pedagógica Nacional de Colombia  in Sep\
            tember 2020. In December 2020 she received a certification for BYU-Pathway completin\
            g to foreign English language learning in one year.
                  </p>
            
            
            
                  <p>  Her works employs the subversive power of the world around us, an individ\
            ual's ability to examine the principles of self-regulation, self-legislation, and se\
            lf-knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>     Her work is based on the principles of autonomy: self-regulation, self-legis\
            lation and self-knowledge in which it takes a theoretical retro-inspection to identi\
            fy the motivators and means that a school physics student may have to be autonomous.\
             based on constructivism, meaningful learning, evidence of an autonomous learner, au\
            tonomous student competencies and motivators.
            </p>
            <p>     The author Nuñez (2020) citing Martínez (2010) Explains the consequences of \
            the lack of autonomy "economic exploitation, political domination, social exclusion,\
             education as a business" (p.90) and these separate individuals from the purpose of \
            the
                    things, of a life in a society that is built for everyone and not for their \
            own interests.
                  </p>

                  The private group of philosophical perspectives and reflections of modern phys\
            ics was founded in 2020 within the emergencies of Covid-19 through the desire to lea\
            rn about the subject for Nuñez and his co-author Nicolas Molina, also a graduate in \
            Physics from the University National Pedagogical.

                  ⁃ Its objective is the Reflection on the concepts of quantum mechanics and mod\
            ern physics from the philosophical formulation and mathematical formalization in ord\
            er to understand the current world.</p>
